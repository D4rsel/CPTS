## Domain Information

Once we have a basic understanding of the company and its services, we can get a first impression of its presence on the Internet. Let us assume that a medium-sized company has hired us to test their entire infrastructure from a black-box perspective. This means we have only received a scope of targets and must obtain all further information ourselves.

Note: Please remember that the examples below will differ from the practical exercises and will not give the same results. However, the examples are based on real penetration tests and illustrate how and what information can be obtained.#### DNS Records

Domain Information

```shell-session
D4rsel@htb[/htb]$ dig any inlanefreight.com
```

The first point of presence on the Internet may be the `SSL certificate` from the company's main website that we can examine. Often, such a certificate includes more than just a subdomain, and this means that the certificate is used for several domains, and these are most likely still active.

Another source to find more subdomains is [crt.sh](https://crt.sh/).

## FTP

Let us imagine that we want to upload local files to a server and download other files using the FTP protocol. In an FTP connection, two channels are opened. First, the client and server establish a control channel through TCP port 21. The client sends commands to the server, and the server returns status codes. Then both communication participants can establish the data channel via ``TCP port 20. This channel is used exclusively for data transmission``, and the protocol watches for errors during this process. If a connection is broken off during transmission, the transport can be resumed after re-established contact.

### Dangerous Settings

There are many different security-related settings we can make on each FTP server. These can have various purposes, such as testing connections through the firewalls, testing routes, and authentication mechanisms. One of these authentication mechanisms is the `anonymous` user. This is often used to allow everyone on the internal network to share files and data without accessing each other's computers. With vsFTPd, the [optional settings](http://vsftpd.beasts.org/vsftpd_conf.html) that can be added to the configuration file for the anonymous login look like this:

| **Setting**                    | **Description**                                                                    |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `anonymous_enable=YES`         | Allowing anonymous login?                                                          |
| `anon_upload_enable=YES`       | Allowing anonymous to upload files?                                                |
| `anon_mkdir_write_enable=YES`  | Allowing anonymous to create new directories?                                      |
| `no_anon_password=YES`         | Do not ask anonymous for password?                                                 |
| `anon_root=/home/username/ftp` | Directory for anonymous.                                                           |
| `write_enable=YES`             | Allow the usage of FTP commands: STOR, DELE, RNFR, RNTO, MKD, RMD, APPE, and SITE? |

### Anon login

```
ftp anonymous@ip
```

### Download All Available Files

```shell-session
D4rsel@htb[/htb]$ wget -m --no-passive ftp://anonymous:anonymous@10.129.14.136
```

### Service Interaction

```shell-session
D4rsel@htb[/htb]$ nc -nv 10.129.14.136 21
```

```shell-session
D4rsel@htb[/htb]$ telnet 10.129.14.136 21
```

It looks slightly different if the FTP server runs with TLS/SSL encryption. Because then we need a client that can handle TLS/SSL. For this, we can use the client `openssl` and communicate with the FTP server. The good thing about using `openssl` is that we can see the SSL certificate, which can also be helpful.

```shell-session
D4rsel@htb[/htb]$ openssl s_client -connect 10.129.14.136:21 -starttls ftp
```

______

## SMB

Now we can display a list (`-L`) of the server's shares with the `smbclient` command from our host. We use the so-called `null session` (`-N`), which is `anonymous` access without the input of existing users or valid passwords.

### SMBclient - Connecting to the Share

```shell-session
D4rsel@htb[/htb]$ smbclient -N -L //10.129.14.128

        Sharename       Type      Comment

### RPCclient

```shell-session
D4rsel@htb[/htb]$ rpcclient -U "" 10.129.14.128

Enter WORKGROUP\'s password:
rpcclient $> 
```

The `rpcclient` offers us many different requests with which we can execute specific functions on the SMB server to get information. A complete list of all these functions can be found on the [man page](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/rpcclient.1.html) of the rpcclient.

|**Query**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`srvinfo`|Server information.|
|`enumdomains`|Enumerate all domains that are deployed in the network.|
|`querydominfo`|Provides domain, server, and user information of deployed domains.|
|`netshareenumall`|Enumerates all available shares.|
|`netsharegetinfo <share>`|Provides information about a specific share.|
|`enumdomusers`|Enumerates all domain users.|
|`queryuser <RID>`|Provides information about a specific user.|

```

Most importantly, anonymous access to such services can also lead to the discovery of other users, who can be attacked with brute-forcing in the most aggressive case. Humans are more error-prone than properly configured computer processes, and the lack of security awareness and laziness often leads to weak passwords that can be easily cracked. Let us see how we can enumerate users using the `rpcclient`.

#### Rpcclient - User Enumeration

SMB

```shell-session
rpcclient $> enumdomusers

user:[mrb3n] rid:[0x3e8]
user:[cry0l1t3] rid:[0x3e9]


rpcclient $> queryuser 0x3e9

        User Name   :   cry0l1t3

        unknown_2[0..31]...
        user_rid :      0x3e8
        group_rid:      0x201
        acb_info :      0x00000010
        fields_present: 0x00ffffff
        logon_divs:     168
        bad_password_count:     0x00000000
        logon_count:    0x00000000
        padding1[0..7]...
        logon_hrs[0..21]...
```

We can then use the results to identify the group's RID, which we can then use to retrieve information from the entire group.

#### Rpcclient - Group Information

```shell-session
rpcclient $> querygroup 0x201

        Group Name:     None
        Description:    Ordinary Users
        Group Attribute:7
        Num Members:2
```

### Brute Forcing User RIDs
However, it can also happen that not all commands are available to us, and we have certain restrictions based on the user. However, the query `queryuser <RID>` is mostly allowed based on the RID. So we can use the rpcclient to brute force the RIDs to get information. Because we may not know who has been assigned which RID, we know that we will get information about it as soon as we query an assigned RID. There are several ways and tools we can use for this. To stay with the tool, we can create a `For-loop` using `Bash` where we send a command to the service using rpcclient and filter out the results.

```shell-session
D4rsel@htb[/htb]$ for i in $(seq 500 1100);do rpcclient -N -U "" 10.129.14.128 -c "queryuser 0x$(printf '%x\n' $i)" | grep "User Name\|user_rid\|group_rid" && echo "";done

        User Name   :   sambauser
        user_rid :      0x1f5
        group_rid:      0x201
		
        User Name   :   mrb3n
        user_rid :      0x3e8
        group_rid:      0x201
		
        User Name   :   cry0l1t3
        user_rid :      0x3e9
        group_rid:      0x201
```

An alternative to this would be a Python script from [Impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket) called [samrdump.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/samrdump.py).

#### Impacket - Samrdump.py

```shell-session
D4rsel@htb[/htb]$ samrdump.py 10.129.14.128
```

The information we have already obtained with `rpcclient` can also be obtained using other tools. For example, the [SMBMap](https://github.com/ShawnDEvans/smbmap) and [CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec) tools are also widely used and helpful for the enumeration of SMB services.

#### SMBmap

## NFS

`Network File System` (`NFS`) is a network file system developed by Sun Microsystems and has the same purpose as SMB. Its purpose is to access file systems over a network as if they were local. However, it uses an entirely different protocol. [NFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System) is used between Linux and Unix systems. This means that NFS clients cannot communicate directly with SMB servers. NFS is an Internet standard that governs the procedures in a distributed file system. While NFS protocol version 3.0 (`NFSv3`), which has been in use for many years, authenticates the client computer, this changes with `NFSv4`. Here, as with the Windows SMB protocol, the user must authenticate.

### Footprinting the Service

When footprinting NFS, the TCP ports `111` and `2049` are essential. We can also get information about the NFS service and the host via RPC, as shown below in the example.

#### Nmap

```shell-session
D4rsel@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -p111,2049 -sV -sC
```

The `rpcinfo` NSE script retrieves a list of all currently running RPC services, their names and descriptions, and the ports they use. This lets us check whether the target share is connected to the network on all required ports. Also, for NFS, Nmap has some NSE scripts that can be used for the scans. These can then show us, for example, the `contents` of the share and its `stats`.

```shell-session
D4rsel@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap --script nfs* 10.129.14.128 -sV -p111,2049
```


#### Show Available NFS Shares

```shell-session
D4rsel@htb[/htb]$ showmount -e 10.129.14.128

Export list for 10.129.14.128:
/mnt/nfs 10.129.14.0/24
```

#### Mounting NFS Share

```shell-session
D4rsel@htb[/htb]$ mkdir target-NFS
D4rsel@htb[/htb]$ sudo mount -t nfs 10.129.14.128:/ ./target-NFS/ -o nolock
D4rsel@htb[/htb]$ cd target-NFS
D4rsel@htb[/htb]$ tree .

.
└── mnt
    └── nfs
        ├── id_rsa
        ├── id_rsa.pub
        └── nfs.share
```

#### List Contents with Usernames & Group Names

```shell-session
D4rsel@htb[/htb]$ ls -l mnt/nfs/

total 16
-rw-r--r-- 1 cry0l1t3 cry0l1t3 1872 Sep 25 00:55 cry0l1t3.priv
-rw-r--r-- 1 cry0l1t3 cry0l1t3  348 Sep 25 00:55 cry0l1t3.pub
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root     1872 Sep 19 17:27 id_rsa
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root      348 Sep 19 17:28 id_rsa.pub
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root        0 Sep 19 17:22 nfs.share
```

#### List Contents with UIDs & GUIDs

```shell-session
D4rsel@htb[/htb]$ ls -n mnt/nfs/

total 16
-rw-r--r-- 1 1000 1000 1872 Sep 25 00:55 cry0l1t3.priv
-rw-r--r-- 1 1000 1000  348 Sep 25 00:55 cry0l1t3.pub
-rw-r--r-- 1    0 1000 1221 Sep 19 18:21 backup.sh
-rw-r--r-- 1    0    0 1872 Sep 19 17:27 id_rsa
-rw-r--r-- 1    0    0  348 Sep 19 17:28 id_rsa.pub
-rw-r--r-- 1    0    0    0 Sep 19 17:22 nfs.share
```

It is important to note that if the `root_squash` option is set, we cannot edit the `backup.sh` file even as `root`.

We can also use NFS for further escalation. For example, if we have access to the system via SSH and want to read files from another folder that a specific user can read, we would need to upload a shell to the NFS share that has the `SUID` of that user and then run the shell via the SSH user.

After we have done all the necessary steps and obtained the information we need, we can unmount the NFS share.

#### Unmounting

```shell-session
D4rsel@htb[/htb]$ cd ..
D4rsel@htb[/htb]$ sudo umount ./target-NFS
```
