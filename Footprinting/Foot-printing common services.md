## Online Presence

Once we have a basic understanding of the company and its services, we can get a first impression of its presence on the Internet. Let us assume that a medium-sized company has hired us to test their entire infrastructure from a black-box perspective. This means we have only received a scope of targets and must obtain all further information ourselves.

Note: Please remember that the examples below will differ from the practical exercises and will not give the same results. However, the examples are based on real penetration tests and illustrate how and what information can be obtained.

The first point of presence on the Internet may be the `SSL certificate` from the company's main website that we can examine. Often, such a certificate includes more than just a subdomain, and this means that the certificate is used for several domains, and these are most likely still active.

Another source to find more subdomains is [crt.sh](https://crt.sh/). This source is [Certificate Transparency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_Transparency) logs. Certificate Transparency is a process that is intended to enable the verification of issued digital certificates for encrypted Internet connections. The standard ([RFC 6962](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6962)) provides for the logging of all digital certificates issued by a certificate authority in audit-proof logs. This is intended to enable the detection of false or maliciously issued certificates for a domain. SSL certificate providers like [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) share this with the web interface [crt.sh](https://crt.sh/), which stores the new entries in the database to be accessed later.
