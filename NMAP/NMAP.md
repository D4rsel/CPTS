## Introduction

### Use Cases

The tool is one of the most used tools by network administrators and IT security specialists. It is used to:

- Audit the security aspects of networks
- Simulate penetration tests
- Check firewall and IDS settings and configurations
- Types of possible connections
- Network mapping
- Response analysis
- Identify open ports
- Vulnerability assessment as well.

### Nmap Architecture

Nmap offers many different types of scans that can be used to obtain various results about our targets. Basically, Nmap can be divided into the following scanning techniques:

- Host discovery
- Port scanning
- Service enumeration and detection
- OS detection
- Scriptable interaction with the target service (Nmap Scripting Engine)

## Host Discovery

| **Scanning Options** | **Description**                                                  |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `10.129.2.0/24`      | Target network range.                                            |
| `-sn`                | Disables port scanning.                                          |
| `-oA tnet`           | Stores the results in all formats starting with the name 'tnet'. |

This scanning method works only if the firewalls of the hosts allow it. Otherwise, we can use other scanning techniques to find out if the hosts are active or not. We will take a closer look at these techniques in "[[#Firewall and IDS Evasion]]".

You can also take a file with IP's as input to nmap:

```shell-session
D4rsel@htb[/htb]$ cat hosts.lst

10.129.2.4
10.129.2.10
10.129.2.11
10.129.2.18
10.129.2.19
10.129.2.20
10.129.2.28
```

If we use the same scanning technique on the predefined list, the command will look like this:

```shell-session
D4rsel@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet -iL hosts.lst
```

## Host and Port Scanning

###  Cheat Sheet

|**Scanning Options**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`10.129.2.28`|Scans the specified target.|
|`-Pn`|Disables ICMP Echo requests.|
|`-n`|Disables DNS resolution.|
|`--disable-arp-ping`|Disables ARP ping.|
|`--packet-trace`|Shows all packets sent and received.|
|`-p 445`|Scans only the specified port.|
|`--reason`|Displays the reason a port is in a particular state.|
|`-sV`|Performs a service scan.|

There are a total of 6 different states for a scanned port we can obtain:

| **State**          | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `open`             | This indicates that the connection to the scanned port has been established. These connections can be **TCP connections**, **UDP datagrams** as well as **SCTP associations**.                          |
| `closed`           | When the port is shown as closed, the TCP protocol indicates that the packet we received back contains an `RST` flag. This scanning method can also be used to determine if our target is alive or not. |
| `filtered`         | Nmap cannot correctly identify whether the scanned port is open or closed because either no response is returned from the target for the port or we get an error code from the target.                  |
| `unfiltered`       | This state of a port only occurs during the **TCP-ACK** scan and means that the port is accessible, but it cannot be determined whether it is open or closed.                                           |
| `open\|filtered`   | If we do not get a response for a specific port, `Nmap` will set it to that state. This indicates that a firewall or packet filter may protect the port.                                                |
| `closed\|filtered` | This state only occurs in the **IP ID idle** scans and indicates that it was impossible to determine if the scanned port is closed or filtered by a firewall.                                           |

By default nmap *scans the top 1000 TCP ports.* 

### Filtered Ports

When a port is shown as filtered, it can have several reasons. In most cases, `firewalls` have certain rules set to handle specific connections. The packets can either be `dropped`, or `rejected`. When a packet gets dropped, `Nmap` receives no response from our target, and by default, the retry rate (`--max-retries`) is set to `10`. This means `Nmap` will resend the request to the target port to determine if the previous packet was accidentally mishandled or not.

### Discovering Open UDP Ports

Some system administrators sometimes forget to filter the UDP ports in addition to the TCP ones. Since `UDP` is a `stateless protocol` and does not require a three-way handshake like TCP. We do not receive any acknowledgment. Consequently, the timeout is much longer, making the whole `UDP scan` (`-sU`) much slower than the `TCP scan` (`-sS`).

Let's look at an example of what a UDP scan (`-sU`) can look like and what results it gives us.

### Version Scan

Another handy method for scanning ports is the `-sV` option which is used to get additional available information from the open ports. This method can identify versions, service names, and details about our target.

________

## Service enumeration

We can also increase the `verbosity level` (`-v` / `-vv`), which will show us the open ports directly when `Nmap` detects them.

*Banner grabbing:*                  **IMPORTANT:** It can give you info that nmap can't.

```shell-session
D4rsel@htb[/htb]$  nc -nv 10.129.2.28 25

Connection to 10.129.2.28 port 25 [tcp/*] succeeded!
220 inlane ESMTP Postfix (Ubuntu)

## Saving the results

While we run various scans, we should always save the results. We can use these later to examine the differences between the different scanning methods we have used. `Nmap` can save the results in 3 different formats.

- Normal output (`-oN`) with the `.nmap` file extension
- Grepable output (`-oG`) with the `.gnmap` file extension
- XML output (`-oX`) with the `.xml` file extension

We can also specify the option (`-oA`) to save the results in all formats.

### Style sheets

With the XML output, we can easily create HTML reports that are easy to read, even for non-technical people. This is later very useful for documentation, as it presents our results in a detailed and clear way. To convert the stored results from XML format to HTML, we can use the tool `xsltproc`.

  Saving the Results

```shell-session
D4rsel@htb[/htb]$ xsltproc target.xml -o target.html
```

If we now open the HTML file in our browser, we see a clear and structured presentation of our results.

## Nmap Scripts

Nmap Scripting Engine (`NSE`) is another handy feature of `Nmap`. It provides us with the possibility to create scripts in Lua for interaction with certain services. There are a total of 14 categories into which these scripts can be divided:

| **Category** | **Description**                                                                                                                         |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `auth`       | Determination of authentication credentials.                                                                                            |
| `broadcast`  | Scripts, which are used for host discovery by broadcasting and the discovered hosts, can be automatically added to the remaining scans. |
| `brute`      | Executes scripts that try to log in to the respective service by brute-forcing with credentials.                                        |
| `default`    | Default scripts executed by using the `-sC` option.                                                                                     |
| `discovery`  | Evaluation of accessible services.                                                                                                      |
| `dos`        | These scripts are used to check services for denial of service vulnerabilities and are used less as it harms the services.              |
| `exploit`    | This category of scripts tries to exploit known vulnerabilities for the scanned port.                                                   |
| `external`   | Scripts that use external services for further processing.                                                                              |
| `fuzzer`     | This uses scripts to identify vulnerabilities and unexpected packet handling by sending different fields, which can take much time.     |
| `intrusive`  | Intrusive scripts that could negatively affect the target system.                                                                       |
| `malware`    | Checks if some malware infects the target system.                                                                                       |
| `safe`       | Defensive scripts that do not perform intrusive and destructive access.                                                                 |
| `version`    | Extension for service detection.                                                                                                        |
| `vuln`       | Identification of specific vulnerabilities.                                                                                             |

We have several ways to define the desired scripts in `Nmap`.

#### Default Scripts

  Nmap Scripting Engine

```shell-session
D4rsel@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap <target> -sC
```

#### Specific Scripts Category

  Nmap Scripting Engine

```shell-session
D4rsel@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap <target> --script <category>
```

#### Defined Scripts

  Nmap Scripting Engine

```shell-session
D4rsel@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap <target> --script <script-name>,<script-name>,...
```
